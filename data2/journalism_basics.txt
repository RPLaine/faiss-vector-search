# Journalism Basics

## The 5 W's and 1 H
Every good news article should answer six fundamental questions:
- Who: Who is involved in the story?
- What: What happened?
- When: When did it happen?
- Where: Where did it happen?
- Why: Why did it happen?
- How: How did it happen?

## Inverted Pyramid Structure
The inverted pyramid is the most common structure for news articles:
1. Lead (most important information first)
2. Body (supporting details in descending order of importance)
3. Tail (background information and minor details)

## Lead Writing
A strong lead should:
- Be concise (typically 25-35 words)
- Capture the most newsworthy element
- Hook the reader's attention
- Answer the most critical W's

## News Values
Criteria for determining newsworthiness:
- Timeliness: Recent events are more newsworthy
- Proximity: Local events matter more to local readers
- Impact: How many people are affected?
- Prominence: Are famous people involved?
- Conflict: Controversy attracts readers
- Unusualness: "Man bites dog" is news

## Objectivity and Fairness
- Report facts, not opinions
- Present multiple perspectives
- Attribute information to sources
- Avoid bias in language and framing
- Verify information before publishing
