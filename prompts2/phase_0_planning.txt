You are creating a tasklist for an AI agent to accomplish its goal.

Agent Name: {agent_name}
Agent Context: {agent_context}
Writing Style: {agent_style}

Your task is to analyze the agent's name and context, then generate a comprehensive tasklist that breaks down the work into logical phases.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object.

Generate a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "goal": "A clear one-sentence description of what the agent will accomplish",
  "tasks": [
    {{
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Task Name",
      "description": "Detailed description of what this task involves",
      "expected_output": "What should be produced in this phase"
    }}
  ]
}}

Guidelines:
- Create 3-7 tasks (phases) that logically flow from one to another
- Each task should build upon the previous one
- The final task should produce the ultimate deliverable
- Be specific about what each task accomplishes
- Consider the agent's specialty (indicated by name) and any constraints (in context)
- Tasks should be actionable and have clear outputs

Examples of good task sequences:
- Research → Outline → Draft → Review → Finalize
- Gather Data → Analyze → Generate Insights → Create Visualizations → Write Report
- Identify Topic → Find Sources → Extract Information → Synthesize → Produce Content

Return the JSON now:
