# Fact-Checking and Verification

## The Verification Process
1. Original source verification
2. Cross-reference with multiple sources
3. Check for conflicts of interest
4. Evaluate source credibility
5. Document verification trail

## Source Evaluation Criteria
### Primary sources
- Eyewitnesses

- Direct participants
- Official records

### Secondary sources
- News reports
- Analysis and commentary
- Expert opinions
- Academic studies

### Assessing credibility
- Expertise and qualifications
- Track record of accuracy
- Potential biases
- Transparency about methods
- Peer review and verification

## Common Verification Tools
- Reverse image search (Google, TinEye)
- WHOIS domain lookup
- Social media verification badges
- Government databases
- Academic repositories
- Freedom of Information requests

## Red Flags to Watch For
- Anonymous sources without verification
- Circular reporting (news outlets citing each other)
- Lack of dates or timestamps
- Vague attributions ("sources say", "experts claim")
- Manipulated images or videos
- Claims without supporting evidence
- Conflicts with established facts

## Fact-Checking Workflow
1. Identify factual claims requiring verification
2. Break down complex claims into checkable components
3. Search for authoritative sources
4. Contact original sources when possible
5. Document findings with citations
6. Update article if errors are found
7. Issue corrections transparently

## Handling Corrections
- Acknowledge errors promptly
- Explain what was wrong and why
